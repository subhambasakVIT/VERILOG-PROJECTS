This project implements a 4x4 Vedic multiplier using the Urdhva Tiryakbhyam (vertical and crosswise) algorithm, a fast and efficient method from ancient Vedic mathematics. The design is modular, hierarchical, and written in Verilog HDL.

The multiplier is constructed using four 2x2 Vedic multiplier blocks, which are then combined using ripple-carry adders (4-bit and 6-bit) to form the final 8-bit product. The architecture ensures reduced propagation delay and efficient resource utilization, making it suitable for high-speed arithmetic units in digital signal processors and embedded systems.

Key components:

2x2 Vedic Multipliers: Compute partial products.

Half Adders: Used in 2x2 multiplication for bit-level additions.

Adders (4-bit and 6-bit): Sum the intermediate results.

Testbench: Applies multiple test vectors to validate correctness of the output.

This project was simulated and verified using timing waveform analysis, ensuring functional accuracy across a variety of input combinations.
